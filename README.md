## ðŸš€ Customer Analytics in Retail: Exploring SQL in a Retail Data Store ðŸš€

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
As part of my SQL journey, I have been exploring Customer Retail Store Data to gain meaningful insights. This project showcases my expertise in SQL through advanced queries, covering various concepts such as CAST, COALESCE, CASE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and Aggregates to analyze customer transactions and sales trends.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key SQL Concepts Covered
â€¢	Data Analysis in Retail â€“ Understanding sales patterns and customer behavior.
â€¢	CASTing Data Types â€“ Converting data formats for accurate calculations and reporting.
â€¢	COALESCE â€“ Handling missing values efficiently.
â€¢	CASE Statements â€“ Applying conditional logic for segmenting customers.
â€¢	GROUP BY & HAVING â€“ Aggregating data to generate business insights.

## ðŸ“Š Example Queries & Use Cases

## 1. Identifying High-Value Customers
This query retrieves customers who have spent more than $500, utilizing GROUP BY and HAVING:

SELECT customer_id,
       SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 500;

âœ… Use Case: Businesses can identify and reward their best customers with exclusive offers or discounts.

## 2. Handling NULL Values with COALESCE
This query ensures missing values in the "phone_number" column are replaced with a default message:

SELECT customer_id, COALESCE(phone_number, 'Unknown') AS contact_number
FROM customers;

âœ… Use Case: Ensures complete customer records and improves customer communication.

## 3. Data Type Conversion using CAST
This query converts order dates from text format to a proper DATE type:

SELECT order_id, CAST(order_date AS DATE) AS formatted_date
FROM sales;

âœ… Use Case: Ensures consistency in date calculations for accurate trend analysis.

## 4. Applying Conditional Logic with CASE
This query categorizes customers based on their total spending:

SELECT customer_id,
       CASE
           WHEN SUM(total_amount) > 1000 THEN 'VIP Customer'
           WHEN SUM(total_amount) BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 THEN 'Regular Customer'
           ELSE 'New Customer'
       END AS customer_category
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;

âœ… Use Case: Helps segment customers for targeted marketing campaigns.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
